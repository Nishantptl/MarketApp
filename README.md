# MarketApp

I made this Application using RecyclerView.


# RecyclerView
<li>
RecyclerView makes it easy to efficiently display large set of data. 
You supplay the data and define how each item looks, nd the RecyclerView library dynamically creates the elements when ther're needed.<br><br>
<li>As the name implies, RecyclerVire recycles those individual elements. When an item scrolls off the screen, RecyclerVire doesn't destroy its view.
Instead, RecyclerView reuses the view for new items that have scrolled on screen.
RecyclerView improves performance and your app's responsiveness, and it reducse power consumption.
