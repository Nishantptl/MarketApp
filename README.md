# MarketApp

I made this Application using RecyclerView.


# RecyclerView
<li>
RecyclerView makes it easy to efficiently display large set of data. 
You supplay the data and define how each item looks, nd the RecyclerView library dynamically creates the elements when ther're needed.<br><br>
<li>As the name implies, RecyclerVire recycles those individual elements. When an item scrolls off the screen, RecyclerVire doesn't destroy its view.
Instead, RecyclerView reuses the view for new items that have scrolled on screen.
RecyclerView improves performance and your app's responsiveness, and it reducse power consumption.


<h2>About App</h2>
<li>This is a basic application which I made using RecyclerView. I used one ImageView and two TextView to show grocery and its details. </li>
<li>Here <b>item_layout.xml</b> file contains the basic structure of one item. <b>item.java</b> file contains strings and int variable for item details.</li>
<li>Once you install this application, you can see four items on screen. When you scroll down 1st and 2nd item will disappear and you will see last two item.</li>
